## Air Quality Index - Europe

The CAQI is a number on a scale from 1 to 100, where a low value means good air quality and a high value means bad air quality. The index is defined in both hourly and daily versions, and separately near and far from roads (a "roadside" or "traffic" index). NO2 and PM10 were the two essential components of the CAQI's roadside index as of 2012. Additionally, PM2.5, CO, and SO2 were optional pollutants. In this dashboard, PM2.5, PM10 and No2 has been considered mainly and an hourly data is given in chart format (Air Quality Index - Wikipedia, 2015)

Hourly data: PM2.5, PM10, NO2, Ozone
Weekly data: PM2.5, PM10, NO2

Requirements
